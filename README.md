# FMLProject

This is the final project of NYU Foundation of Machine Learning course. Xinyue Chen, Licheng Shen and I cooperated on this project in which we proposed stop criterion to batch DRL algorithms, BCQ and BAIL. 

We realized the implementation of the stop criterion using the author's github open source and incorporated our algorithms into it. We also made sure that the performance matches with the author's original paper.

Thank you!
